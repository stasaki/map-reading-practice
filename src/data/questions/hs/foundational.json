      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Parallel structure requires items in a list to follow the same grammatical pattern. Answer B uses three gerunds (reading, swimming, hiking). The other options mix gerunds, infinitives, and conjugated verbs."

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "A semicolon joins two independent clauses that are closely related. 'The experiment failed' and 'the temperature was too high' are both complete sentences. Answer A is wrong because 'because' makes the second part a dependent clause, which should not follow a semicolon."

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "In sentence A, 'Walking through the park' is a participial phrase that should modify the subject that follows. But the subject is 'the birds,' implying the birds were walking through the park. This is a dangling modifier. Sentence B correctly makes 'Maria' the subject."

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The subjunctive mood is used for hypothetical or contrary-to-fact conditions. 'If I were' (not 'was') is the correct subjunctive form because the speaker is not actually the president. This applies regardless of the subject being singular."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "A colon should follow an independent clause (a complete sentence). 'There are three branches of government' is a complete thought. In answers A, B, and D, the colon interrupts the natural flow between a verb and its object — 'are,' 'include,' and 'has' all need their complements without a colon."

      "correctAnswer": "A",

In answer C, both sides follow the same pattern: 'rejected by the board' / 'opposed by the shareholders' (past participle + by + agent). The other options break this symmetry."
