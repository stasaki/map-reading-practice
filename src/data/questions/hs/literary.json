      "text": "I sometimes fancy that in my condition if I had less opposition and more society and stimulus — but John says the very worst thing I can do is to think about my condition, and I confess it always makes me feel bad.\n\nSo I will let it alone and talk about the house. The most beautiful place! It is quite alone, standing well back from the road, quite three miles from the village. It makes me think of English places that you read about, for there are hedges and walls and gates that lock, and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and people.\n\nThere is a delicious garden! I never saw such a garden — large and shady, full of box-bordered paths. I should hate it if John and I had it for the summer. He is very careful and loving, and hardly lets me stir without special direction. I have a schedule for each hour of the day; he takes all care from me, and so I feel basely ungrateful not to value it more.",

Near them, on the sand,\nHalf sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\nAnd wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\nTell that its sculptor well those passions read\nWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\nThe hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;\nAnd on the pedestal, these words appear:\nMy name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;\nLook on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!\nNothing beside remains. Round the decay\nOf that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.\"",

Privately he doubted more than ever whether these formal visits on a succession of total strangers would do much towards helping the nerve cure which he was supposed to be undergoing.\n\n\"Do you know many of the people round here?\" asked the niece, when she judged that they had had sufficient silent communion.\n\n\"Hardly a soul,\" said Framton. \"My sister was staying here, at the rectory, you know, some four years ago, and she gave me letters of introduction to some of the people here.\"\n\nHe made the last statement in a tone of distinct regret.",

      "explanation": "The narrator simultaneously praises John as 'careful and loving' while revealing he 'hardly lets me stir without special direction' and dictates her schedule. This tension between her stated gratitude and described confinement reveals an unreliable self-assessment shaped by her disempowered position."
