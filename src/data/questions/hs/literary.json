The most beautiful place! It is quite alone, standing well back from the road, quite three miles from the village. It makes me think of English places that you read about, for there are hedges and walls and gates that lock, and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and people.\n\nThere is a delicious garden! I never saw such a garden — large and shady, full of box-bordered paths. I should hate it if John and I had it for the summer. He is very careful and loving, and hardly lets me stir without special direction. I have a schedule for each hour of the day; he takes all care from me, and so I feel basely ungrateful not to value it more.",

Round the decay\nOf that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.\"",

Privately he doubted more than ever whether these formal visits on a succession of total strangers would do much towards helping the nerve cure which he was supposed to be undergoing.\n\n\"Do you know many of the people round here?\" asked the niece, when she judged that they had had sufficient silent communion.\n\n\"Hardly a soul,\" said Framton. \"My sister was staying here, at the rectory, you know, some four years ago, and she gave me letters of introduction to some of the people here.\"\n\nHe made the last statement in a tone of distinct regret.",
