      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "When a sentence begins with an introductory phrase or clause (like 'Before we eat'), a comma is placed after that phrase, before the main part of the sentence. Answer A correctly places the comma after 'Before we eat.'"

        { "label": "D", "text": "The dogs am playing in the yard." }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The subject 'dogs' is plural, so it needs the plural verb form 'were.' 'Was,' 'is,' and 'am' are all singular verb forms that do not agree with the plural subject."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "A complete sentence needs a subject and a predicate (verb). 'The cat sat on the windowsill' has a subject ('The cat') and a predicate ('sat on the windowsill'). The other options are fragments — they are missing a subject, a verb, or express an incomplete thought."

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Answer B correctly combines the sentences using the subordinating conjunction 'After,' which shows the relationship between the two events (the rain stopping caused the children to go outside). Answer A is a run-on, C is a comma splice, and D doesn't make sense."
